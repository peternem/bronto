  <h1>Willy</h1>
  <p>Willy is our pure single speed 29er. Due to the additional clearance required for a front derailleur with 29ers, we are able to shorten up the chain stays a touch on our single speed. This will help the riding characteristics and help you grind up those hills.</p>
  <p>29ers themselves need special tubing considerations, and working in all that tire clearance and chainstay forming requires nothing short of Todd's special powers at their best. A lot of work goes into each one of these frames, and the result - we think it's the best 29er single speed out there. Granted, there are a lot of good ones, but we think you'll like ours.</p>
