  <h1>Paycheck</h1>
  <p>All the fantastic riding we have here in central Oregon goes something like this: long climb up.  Break.  Long singletrack descent.  So we decided to create the perfect bike for big-mountain riding - the Paycheck.  We started with 26" wheels, a longer travel 140mm fork, and a relaxed (but not too relaxed) 68.5 degree head tube angle.  The result?  Well we think you'll be hard-pressed to find a machine that loves to devour trails more than this one.</p>
  <p>The Paycheck comes standard with a bent top tube for more standover height and clearance for big 2.5" tires, as well as a burly front-end to take whatever you can throw at her.  As with all Brontos, we use a combination of Platinum OX and other chrome-moly tubes.  All those curvy tubes are bent in-house, just like painting and all the other steps of production until she's safely packed in a box.</p>
  <p>We think you're going to like our new model as much as we do.  Drop the fork, settle in for the climb, and then open up the fork and earn your paycheck.</p>
